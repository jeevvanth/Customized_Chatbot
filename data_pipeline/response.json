The agencies did not propose any postponements of disclosure in the records related to incident 2024-003-066. NARA, the Department of Justice, and the FBI proposed 559 postponements in the records related to the other two incidents. The FBI later withdrew 44 of the postponements the Bureau proposed. On May 9, 2025 and May 16, 2025, the Review Board met and approved 161 postponements and portions of 33 additional postponements, and determined that 354 pages in full and 64 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.",
