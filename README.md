# # Customized Chatbot
A powerful chatbot application built using FastAPI, LangChain, Gradio, and Ollama, with integrated support for document processing and conversational AI over official U.S. Federal Registry documents.

# Overview
This project demonstrates a robust chatbot implementation that integrates:

FastAPI for API backend

Ollama (running llama3:8b) for inference

LangChain for document retrieval & prompt engineering

Gradio for a user-friendly interface

MySQL as the backend database

Additionally, it performs a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline by migrating and processing JSON data from the U.S. Federal Registry API.

üìò API Reference: Federal Register Developer Docs

# Features
 LangChain Integration
Smart document retrieval and contextual response generation.

# LLaMA 3 (8B) via Ollama
Efficient, locally hosted language model integration using llama3:8b.

# ETL Pipeline
JSON data from the Federal Register API is cleaned, processed, and stored into a MySQL database.

# SQL + Summarization Prompt Chaining
Dual prompt mechanism to generate SQL from natural language and then summarize the results.

# Gradio Interface
Clean and interactive web UI for seamless chatbot experience.

Copy
Edit
cd chatbot
python main.py
üì° API Endpoints
POST /chat
Accepts a natural language query and returns a chatbot response.
Internally uses:

A SQL Prompt to extract query

A Summary Prompt to present user-friendly output

# üñºÔ∏è Interface
Launch the Gradio-based web UI to interact with the chatbot in real-time.
