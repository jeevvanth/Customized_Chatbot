🤖 Customized Chatbot
A powerful chatbot application built using FastAPI, LangChain, Gradio, and Ollama, with integrated support for document processing and conversational AI over official U.S. Federal Registry documents.

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a robust chatbot implementation that integrates:

FastAPI for API backend

Ollama (running llama3:8b) for inference

LangChain for document retrieval & prompt engineering

Gradio for a user-friendly interface

MySQL as the backend database

Additionally, it performs a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline by migrating and processing JSON data from the U.S. Federal Registry API.

📘 API Reference: Federal Register Developer Docs

🚀 Features
🔍 LangChain Integration

🤖 LLaMA 3 (8B) via Ollama
Efficient, locally hosted language model integration using llama3:8b.

💾 ETL Pipeline
JSON data from the Federal Register API is cleaned, processed, and stored into a MySQL database.

🧠 SQL + Summarization Prompt Chaining
Dual prompt mechanism to generate SQL from natural language and then summarize the results.

🖼️ Gradio Interface
Clean and interactive web UI for seamless chatbot experience.
